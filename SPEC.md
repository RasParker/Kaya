# Grocery Market App â€“ Specification

## Overview
The Grocery Market App is an online marketplace that connects **buyers, sellers, kayayo (market assistants), riders, and an admin**.  
It allows buyers to shop for groceries, sellers to list products, kayayo to help with market pickups, riders to deliver items, and an admin to oversee and manage the platform.  

The goal is to create a lightweight but scalable platform where each role has its own workflow.
