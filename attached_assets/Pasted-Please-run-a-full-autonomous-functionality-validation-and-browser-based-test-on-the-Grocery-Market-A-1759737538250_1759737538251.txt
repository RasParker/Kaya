Please run a full autonomous functionality validation and browser-based test on the Grocery Market App.

Goals:
1. Verify, repair, and complete all role-specific flows (Buyer, Seller, Kayayo, Rider, Admin).
2. Automatically detect and fix missing or broken functionalities.
3. Optimize UI navigation and ensure full alignment with SPEC.md and USER_FLOWS.md.

Tasks:
1. Launch the app and simulate real-world user behavior for each role:
   - Buyer: login, browse, add to cart, checkout, make payment, track order, rate order.
   - Seller: login, view products, add/edit items, handle incoming orders, update order status, view earnings.
   - Kayayo: login, view assigned pickups, confirm pickup, mark handover, view history.
   - Rider: login, accept delivery, confirm pickup from Kayayo, complete delivery, view history and earnings.
   - Admin: login, manage users, monitor orders, view analytics, handle disputes, and manage payments/markets.

2. Automatically identify and fix issues such as:
   - Missing or broken links, pages, and components.
   - Non-functional buttons or form submissions.
   - API endpoints not returning expected data.
   - Incomplete UI flows (e.g., missing confirmation pages or actions).
   - State updates not reflected in dashboards.
   - Missing transitions between key user actions (e.g., order ‚Üí pickup ‚Üí delivery).

3. Detect and implement missing functionalities such as:
   - Notifications (basic toast or in-app alerts for status updates).
   - Order status syncing across all roles.
   - Loading states and error handling on slow or failed requests.
   - Basic ratings/review submission for Buyers.
   - Transaction/earnings history for Sellers, Kayayo, and Riders.
   - Dispute flow initiation (Buyer flagging an order) linked to Admin panel.
   - Log-out functionality for all roles.

4. Perform visual and browser tests:
   - Verify all pages load correctly in a browser.
   - Check responsiveness and layout consistency.
   - Test button clicks, form submissions, and navigation paths.
   - Capture screenshots for failed pages or unhandled routes.

5. Generate a detailed report:
   - ‚úÖ Functional flows verified
   - ‚öôÔ∏è Missing features implemented
   - üß© Broken links/components fixed
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Unresolved issues (with brief notes)
   - ‚è± Execution summary (tests passed, fixed, skipped)

6. Do not overwrite SPEC.md or USER_FLOWS.md ‚Äî use them strictly as reference for expected behavior.

Objective:
Ensure the Grocery Market App is fully functional and feature-complete for all user roles (Buyer, Seller, Kayayo, Rider, Admin), with no broken navigation, missing actions, or unimplemented pages. The app should be ready for demo or MVP launch testing.
