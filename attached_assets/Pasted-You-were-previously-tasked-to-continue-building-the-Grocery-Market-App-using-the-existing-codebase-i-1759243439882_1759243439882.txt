You were previously tasked to continue building the Grocery Market App using the existing codebase in this workspace.


You were instructed to use these two reference files for guidance:
SPEC.md → functional requirements and flows (all roles, including Admin).
USER_FLOWS.md → detailed screen-by-screen user journeys.
Tasks:
Fix the Task page on the Kayayo plaform. It currently has an error on the page (404 Page Not Found)
Begin implementing the Admin Portal as described in SPEC.md and USER_FLOWS.md:
Admin login with email/password.
Admin dashboard with KPIs (active users, trips, revenue, issues).
User Management: approve/suspend/remove accounts, verify IDs.
Order Monitoring: view active orders, track delays, reassign if needed.
Payments & Escrow: show amounts held/released, freeze suspicious payments, export reports.
Dispute Resolution: review complaints, evidence, and issue refunds/penalties.
Marketplace Setup: add new markets, approve seller categories.
Ratings & Trust: monitor low-rated/fake accounts.
Analytics: user activity, delivery times, top-selling items, busiest markets.
Make sure Admin is a separate role with its own login and interface (not mixed with Buyer/Seller/etc).
Keep all UI layouts aligned with the details in USER_FLOWS.md.
Do not overwrite SPEC.md or USER_FLOWS.md — only use them as references.
Objective: Build forward from the current MVP, ensuring each role (Buyer, Seller, Kayayo, Rider, Admin) has a working dashboard with role-specific actions and connected flows.

Note: This app is supposed to use a persistent database (PostgreSQL via Drizzle) and not in-memory storage (MemStorage). Please migrate any implementation done using in-memory storage (MemStorage) to a persistent database (PostgreSQL via Drizzle). Finally remove in-memory storage (MemStorage) from the app completely. We dont want it and we dont need it, pls remove it.
