Please run a full autonomous test pass on the Grocery Market App using the browser testing capability.
Goal:
Verify that all user flows (Buyer, Seller, Kayayo, Rider) work end-to-end according to SPEC.md and USER_FLOWS.md.
Tasks:
Launch the app in a browser and simulate real user behavior for each role:
Buyer: login, browse products, add to cart, checkout, place order, track order.
Seller: login, view incoming orders, accept/reject, update product availability.
Kayayo: login, view assigned pickups, mark picked, hand over to rider.
Rider: login, view deliveries, accept, confirm pickup, complete delivery.
Automatically detect and fix issues such as:
Broken or missing links
Missing features
Buttons not working or unresponsive
Pages that fail to load or throw errors
API calls returning errors or no data
Misrouted navigation between steps
Use the Playwright test setup (if available) or your built-in browser testing tools.
Capture logs, screenshots, and console errors for each failed step.
Attempt automatic repair where possible (adjust routes, fix missing pages, reconnect components).
After completing tests and fixes, generate a summary report showing:
✅ Passed flows
⚠️ Fixed issues
❌ Remaining errors with notes on what needs manual review
Do not overwrite SPEC.md or USER_FLOWS.md; use them only as reference for expected behavior.
Objective:
Ensure all user flows (Buyer, Seller, Kayayo, Rider) are fully functional, with no broken pages, buttons, or navigation errors. Produce a clear report and leave the app in a working state.
IMPORTANT: Work autonomously - don't ask for clarification. Make the best technical decisions to ensure a polished, working marketplace application

Planned workflow for testing application (6 seconds)
Now let me read the complete specifications and check the current application status:
Planned comprehensive test execution (5 seconds)
Perfect! The application is now running. Let me check the logs to ensure everything is working correctly, then I'll execute a comprehensive test plan for all user roles.
Checked console and system logs
Planned user role testing execution
Good! The application is running successfully. I can see the database is seeded and the server is operational. I notice there's a minor WebSocket configuration issue, but it shouldn't affect the main functionality. Now let me create a comprehensive test plan and execute automated tests for all user roles.
Tested buyer flow completion
Now I'll execute comprehensive browser tests for all user flows. Let me start with testing the Buyer flow:
Decided on manual visual testing approach (5 seconds)
I see. Let me use the screenshot tool to manually test and verify each user flow. I'll systematically go through each role, identify issues, and fix them. Let me start with the Buyer flow.
Took a screenshot
Planned comprehensive testing approach (4 seconds)
Good! The home page loads correctly with a login screen. I can see the "Manual Login" and "Test Logins" tabs. Now let me systematically check each user role's functionality. Let me first search for the routes and understand what pages should exist for each role.
Searched for "What are all the buyer routes and pages that should be available for buyers?"
Identified missing rider route (5 seconds)
I found the first issue! The rider deliveries page is referenced in the navigation but the route doesn't exist. Let me check admin routes and then systematically test and fix all issues.
Searched for "What are all the admin routes and pages available for admin users?"
Decided on rider deliveries route
Perfect! I've identified the first issue. Let me now use the architect to analyze the codebase comprehensively against the specifications to identify all missing features and broken functionality.
Analyzed codebase against specifications and user flows
Decided on route gap analysis
Let me manually analyze the routing and navigation to identify all issues:
Decided on missing route strategy (6 seconds)
Perfect! I've identified the first critical issue:
Issue #1: Missing /rider/deliveries route
The navigation references it (line 34 in bottom-nav.tsx)
But the route doesn't exist in App.tsx
No page file exists for it
Let me create the missing rider deliveries page and add the route. First, let me check what the rider dashboard looks like to understand the pattern:
Opened client/src/pages/rider/dashboard.tsx
Planned rider deliveries page creation
I see there are some TypeScript errors in the rider dashboard. Let me check them and then create the missing rider deliveries page:
Checked code issues
Created rider deliveries page
Now let me create the missing rider deliveries page and fix the issues. I'll create a comprehensive deliveries page for riders:
Created client/src/pages/rider/deliveries.tsx
Decided on next steps completion
Perfect! Now let me add the route to App.tsx and fix the TypeScript errors:
Decided on rider deliveries page
Excellent! I've fixed the first major issue. Let me check if the TypeScript errors are resolved and restart the workflow:
Decided to complete task pending review
Perfect! The TypeScript errors are fixed. Let me update the task list and continue comprehensive testing:
Planned comprehensive feature identification (5 seconds)
Now let me systematically search for any other missing features or routes. Let me check the logs first and then continue with comprehensive testing:
Checked console and system logs
Identified missing features from spec
Good! The server is running. Now let me search for specific features mentioned in the specifications to ensure they're all implemented:
Searched for "Are product images, seller stall profiles, and product categories fully implemented in the buyer browse and product pages?"
Decided on Kayayo selection implementation
Good insights! I found several things to check. Let me examine the cart page to see if kayayo selection is actually implemented:
Opened client/src/pages/buyer/cart.tsx
Decided on kayayo selection logic
Good! I can see kayayo selection is implemented. Let me continue reading the cart page to see the UI:
Opened client/src/pages/buyer/cart.tsx
Determined cart page kayayo selection (4 seconds)
Perfect! Kayayo selection IS fully implemented. Now let me check critical missing features. Let me examine if the QR/PIN handover verification system exists:
Determined existence of review and dispute tables
Good! The database schemas exist for reviews and disputes. But let me check if the UI is actually implemented for these features:
Decided on missing feature list (5 seconds)
I found critical missing features! Let me check what the buyer orders page currently shows:
Opened client/src/pages/buyer/orders.tsx
Decided on feature documentation and prioritization (9 seconds)
Let me now compile all findings and create a comprehensive analysis. Let me check a few more critical areas:
Planned feature prioritization and fixing (9 seconds)
Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me update my task list and systematically fix all issues. I'll create a summary document first:


In progress tasks 1 / 7

Created rider deliveries page and route - COMPLETED
Create buyer review screen for ratings
