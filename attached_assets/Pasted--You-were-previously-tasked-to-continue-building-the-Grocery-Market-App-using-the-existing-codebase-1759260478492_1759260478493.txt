
You were previously tasked to continue building the Grocery Market App using the existing codebase in this workspace.


You were instructed to use these two reference files for guidance:
SPEC.md → functional requirements and flows (all roles, including Admin).
USER_FLOWS.md → detailed screen-by-screen user journeys.
Tasks:
Begin implementing the Admin Portal as described in SPEC.md and USER_FLOWS.md:
Admin login with email/password.
Admin dashboard with KPIs (active users, trips, revenue, issues).
User Management: approve/suspend/remove accounts, verify IDs.
Order Monitoring: view active orders, track delays, reassign if needed.
Payments & Escrow: show amounts held/released, freeze suspicious payments, export reports.
Dispute Resolution: review complaints, evidence, and issue refunds/penalties.
Marketplace Setup: add new markets, approve seller categories.
Ratings & Trust: monitor low-rated/fake accounts.
Analytics: user activity, delivery times, top-selling items, busiest markets.
Make sure Admin is a separate role with its own login and interface (not mixed with Buyer/Seller/etc).
Keep all UI layouts aligned with the details in USER_FLOWS.md.
Do not overwrite SPEC.md or USER_FLOWS.md — only use them as references.
Objective: Build forward from the current MVP, ensuring each role (Buyer, Seller, Kayayo, Rider, Admin) has a working dashboard with role-specific actions and connected flows.
